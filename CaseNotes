Data storage and preservation of access

Data will be stored in the selected cloud-based storage location and on the university site in the institutional physical repository. Both of these options are institutionally supported and will be free for researches, students and staff who work with or closely tied to the research that Dr. Periwinkles. The fact the storage methods are supported by the institution allow for increased data sharing internally. There was also the addition of data sharing protocol that was implemented to address the information sharing protocol for individuals in the research community that would like to access Dr. Periwinkles raw data. With the expansion of the data sharing protocol to deal with external researchers of the university, it can also be concluded that these individuals will have access to the cloud-based storage location via personalized login information. As for individuals who do not work in the university or haven’t been granted authorization to access raw data there is still the public facing OceanViewer.org. OceanViewer.org is open online platform for sharing oceans-related findings.
